      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if this works yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s a good start to check if it will work or not.
So, I&amp;rsquo;m trying this from the new Mac.
Adding more content on this page is supposed to publish this page as a blog post for today&amp;rsquo;s date. I&amp;rsquo;m wondering why it hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed yet.
Glad to find that Draft option and changed it to false and it works as expected. Publishing this one and then deploying.</description>

      <title>Continuing with Hugo</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m making progress with Hugo and restarting back with it to learn about Hugo and Git. It&amp;rsquo;s very fun to start trying to learn code. It&amp;rsquo;s been a really long long time since I played around with some code and I would be delighted to continue learning code.
The only question is do I have the desired discipline and motivation for it. We will see and time will tell üòÄ.</description>

      <title>A poem for Maths Teacher</title>

      <description>You brought numbers into our lives
Alphabets you knew 6 and how I wish they weren&amp;rsquo;t algebraic
Logs were tricky and decimals weren&amp;rsquo;t fun
but solved complex equations only for U
Problems you had infinite from the book or life
With solutions you nurtured logic and common sense
Trigonometry was monotony
until you came up with geometry.
Oh! And I Never knew shapes would be this important
Until I met the gym coach He&amp;rsquo;s a constant remainder for size zero.</description>

      <description>Second day fiddling via the CLI and git and hugo. And here is a list of things that I have done.
Tweaked my Zshrc config file with a bunch of UI hacks. Upgraded my command line tools to Big sur&amp;rsquo;s versions, it was outdated, surprising that I was running CLI tools from Mojave if I am not wrong. A first time ever 60 tabs on the current Firefox window, mostly due to debuggings.</description>

      <description>I am testing if things moved out well with Hugo after the upgrade to Big sur on the iMac. ü§ûüèΩ This worked much better than I expected. So not bad at all. All the changes survived through the upgrade. So this rocks.</description>
