  <p>You brought numbers into our lives
Alphabets you knew  6 and how I wish they weren&rsquo;t  <strong>algebraic</strong>
<strong>Logs</strong> were tricky and <strong>decimals</strong> weren&rsquo;t  fun<br>
but solved  <strong>complex</strong> <strong>equations</strong> only for U
Problems you had <strong>infinite</strong> from the book or life
With solutions you nurtured <strong>logic</strong> and common sense
<strong>Trigonometry</strong> was monotony
until you came up with <strong>geometry</strong>.
Oh!
And I Never knew <strong>shapes</strong> would be this important<br>
Until I met the gym coach
He&rsquo;s a <strong>constant</strong>  <strong>remainder</strong> for size <strong>zero</strong>.</p>
<p>I might not remember all the math you taught
I definetly don&rsquo;t use all the math you taught
But I still owe you a <strong>tonne</strong>
not  because
you brought numbers into our lives
But only because you breathed your life into us
in our <strong>prime</strong>
More true now that   <strong>Binary</strong> and <strong>Boolean</strong><br>
provides us for our lives  :)</p>
